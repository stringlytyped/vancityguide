 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

// We use SCSS imports instead of sprockets to make variables and mixins available elsewhere in our
// stylesheets. Additionally, the order in which we load SCSS code is important (specifically,
// 1_settings and 2_tools need be loaded first, because they contain variables and mixins).

@import "./1_settings/*";
@import "./2_tools/*";
@import "./3_generic/*";
@import "./4_elements/*";
